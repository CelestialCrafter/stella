# stella

space & planet app!

## known issues:

- invalid/weird feature combos are treated as valid,
  this does not matter because features will be
  generated by the server in a future update

- models are huge (62mb max)

- models directory is revealed when fetching a planet

- transfering a planet to a non-extent user basically voids the planet

- api returns "x not found" error when the error is actually "you do not own x"

- frontend does not space out planets correctly
